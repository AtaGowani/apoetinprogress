My sweet morning dreams I wish not to indulge anymore

for they keep me away from your sweet morning voice.

No camera I wish to hold anymore

for I am afraid it will cost me a true glimpse at your smile.

No compliments I wish to express anymore

for the language we share doesnâ€™t have the words to contain your beauty.
