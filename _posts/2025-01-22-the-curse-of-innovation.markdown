oh what great inventions we've brought to life

what great promises came along as lies

"we'll free the oppressed, cure the sick, feed the poor"

"no one will ever live life as before"

before we could look around and realize we've been betrayed

we told innovation is natural, it'd be insane to look at it any other way

so let's continue, let's move forward, let's not stop to think

we can just ignore the fires around us. let's not get caught up in climate change

**come join us, let's innovate. don't let your morals lead you astray**
