Growing when I learned about atrocities in history class

I always struggled to understand how people could've let something like that pass

As a boy, I told myself they were just not like us

Didn't have their courage and morals sorted out â€“ unlike us

Oh how wrong the world has proven the boy I used to be

For we have seen spineless cowards and greedy leaders support a genocide with glee

**To that boy today I say**

Be the voice you had hoped the people in your history books had raised

For cruel atrocities are not just a thing of the past

Just look around and you'd be amazed
