As a kid, I dreamt of love. I was so familiar with its smile, its laughter, and all its beauty. 

Or so I thought until I met you. Love caught me by surprise and swept me away. When it came, I didn’t even recognize it. 

It showed me joy — the kind you can only experience and never explain. It showed me compassion and gave me a heart to look after. 

It was the kind where mornings seemed brighter than they were and simple things around were now more beautiful than they’d ever been. 

Then one day it left. It washed me off, forgot me — didn’t even look back to say goodbye. 

I didn’t close the door behind it as it left. 

**I don’t want to fail to welcome it if it ever comes back.**
